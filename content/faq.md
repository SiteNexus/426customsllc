  - question: "How long does a typical window tinting job take?"
    answer: "Most standard vehicles can be tinted within 2-4 hours, right at your location. Larger vehicles or complex jobs might take a bit longer."
  - question: "What kind of warranty do you offer on your services?"
    answer: "We stand by our work! We use premium materials that come with manufacturer warranties (e.g., against fading, bubbling for tints/wraps). We also guarantee our workmanship. Specific warranty details vary by service and will be provided with your quote."
  - question: "Do I need to provide anything for the mobile service?"
    answer: "Ideally, we need access to a covered area like a garage or carport to protect your vehicle and our materials from direct sun, wind, or rain during the service. Access to a power outlet is sometimes helpful but not always required. We'll discuss specifics when you book."

    answer: "We serve most of Miami-Dade county. Please contact us with your specific location to confirm availability and any potential travel fees for extended areas."
  - question: "How do I care for my new window tint or vinyl wrap?"
